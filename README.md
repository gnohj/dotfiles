This repo houses my personal dotfiles, tailored for an efficient development workflow (MacOS). It includes configurations for Neovim, Zsh, and Tmux, among other tools, optimized for speed and simplicity.

I've also configured my [Glove80](https://my.glove80.com/?ref=arslan.io#/layout/user/aac120b9-fa8a-4095-83dd-c9070d22b3c0) keyboard layout to integrate seamlessly with my workflow. Feel free to check it out for ideas or inspiration!
